# Data Manipulation

Data manipulation consists of transforming a data set to be analyzed. Certain statistical methods require data sets to be formatted in a certain way before you can apply a certain function^[Linear Mixed-Effects Models.]. Other times, you will need to transform the data set to present to stakeholder. Therefore, being able to transform a data set is essential.

## Warnings Suppressed

In order to keep the page concise, the warning messages have been suppressed. These warnings were produced because functions were applied to incorrect inputs, ie $\sqrt{A}$. Therefore, you may see `NA` as the output. There is nothing wrong with the code, it is just that the input was not valid, but R still completed the task. 
:::


## Tidyverse

Tidyverse is a set of packages that make data manipulation much easier. These are functions that many individuals from the R community find useful to use for data analysis. In my opinion, once you have understand how Tidyverse packages function, it makes it much easier to work with than Base R. Many of the functions are descriptively named for easy remembrance. For the most part, you can do almost everything that Base R can do. There are just a few things you can't do, but it is rare that you will use them. One last thing is that the output from tidyverse is always formatted as a tibble class, the Tidyverse version of the data frame. This can have some ups and downs. However, think of a tibble as a lazier data frame. If you haven't done so, install tidyverse:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Then load tidyverse into R:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

This will load the main Tidyverse packages: `ggplot2`, `tibble`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purr`, `dplyr`, `stringr`, and `forcats`.


## Loading Data

There are three methods to load a data set in R: using base R, using Tidyverse, or using RStudio. While it is important to understand how the code works to load a data set, I recommend using RStudio to import the data. It does all the work for you. Additionally, if you decide to use Tidyverse packages, RStudio will provide corresponding code for a particular file.

To import a data set using RStudio, head over to the environment tab (usually in the upper right hand pane) and click on the Import Dataset button. A pop-up window should look something like below.


```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/import.png")
```

Notice how there are several options to load a data set. Depending on the format, you may want to choose one of those options. Next, notice how there are 2 "From Text". This is because it will load text data using either Base R packages or the `readr` package from tidyverse. Either works, but the `readr` package provides the necessary code to load the data set in the window. The other one provides the code in the console. 


### CSV Files 

A CSV file is a type of text file that where the values are separated from commas. It is very common file that you will work with. Here I will provide the code necessary to import a CSV file using either Base R or `readr` package code.

#### Base R

```{r}
#| eval: false
read.csv("FILE_NAME_AND_LOCATION")
```

#### `readr` package

```{r}
#| eval: false
read_csv("FILE_NAME_AND_LOCATION")
```

Notice that the functions are virtually the same. 

### For This Chapter

You will need to download and extract this zip [file](https://www.inqs.info/stat_comp/files/data.zip) to conduct the analysis in the chapter. The code below will load the data sets you need:

```{r}
data1 <- read_csv("data/data_3_1.csv")
data2 <- read_csv("data/data_3_2.csv")
data3 <- read_csv("data/data_3_3.csv")
data4 <- read_csv("data/data_3_6.csv")
data5 <- read_csv("data/data_3_7.csv")
data6 <- read_csv("data/data_3_5.csv")
data7 <- read_csv("data/data_3_4.csv")
```

Make sure to change the file location as needed.

## The Pipe Operator `|>`

The main benefit of the pipe operator is to make the code easier to read. The base pipe `|>` was added in R 4.0. What the pipe operator, `|>`, does is that it will take the output from a previous function and it will use it as the input for the next function. This prevents us from nesting functions together and overwhelm us with numerous parentheses and commas. To practice, pipe `data` into the `glimpse()`.

```{r}
data1 |> glimpse()
```

The `glimpse()` provides basic variable information about `data1`. I recommend practice reading the code in plain English to help you understand how these functions. 


## Data Transformation

This section focuses on manipulating the data to obtain basic statistics, such as obtaining the mean for different categories. Many of the functions used here are from the `dplyr` package.

### Summarizing Data

Summarizing Data is one of the most important thing in statistics. First, let's get the mean for all the variables in `data1`. This is done by using the `summarize_all()`. All you need to do is provide the function you want R to provide. Pipe `data1` into the `summarize_all()` and specify `mean` in the function.

```{r}
data1 |> summarise_all(mean)
```

Notice how some values are `NA`, this is because the variables are character data types. Therefore, it will not be able to compute the mean. Now find the standard deviation for the data set.

```{r}
data1 |> summarise_all(sd)
```

Now lets create a frequency table for the `cat1` variable in `data1`. use the `count()` and specify the variable you are interested in:

```{r}
data1 |> count(cat1)
```

Now, repeat for `cat2` in `data1`:

```{r}
data1 |> count(cat2)
```


### Grouping

Summarizing data is great, but sometimes you may want to group data and obtain summary statistics for those groups. This is done by using the `group_by()` and specify which variable you want to group. Try grouping `data1` by `cat1`:

```{r}
data1 |> group_by(cat1)
```

Great! You now have grouped data; however, this is not helpful. We can use this output and summarize the groups. All we need to do is pipe the output to the `summarise_all()`. Group `data1` by `cat1` and find the mean:

```{r}
data1 |> group_by(cat1) |> summarise_all(mean)
```


If we want to group by two variables, all we need to do is specify both variables in the `group_by()`. Group `data1` by `cat1` and `cat2` then find the mean:

```{r}
data1 |> group_by(cat1,cat2) |> summarise_all(mean)
```

Now, instead of finding the mean for all variables in a data set, we are only interested in viewing `var1`. We can use the `summarise()` and type the R code for finding the mean for the particular variable. Group `data1` by `cat1` and find the mean for `var1`:

```{r}
data1 |> group_by(cat1) |> summarise(mean(var1))
```

### Subsets

On occasion, you may need to create a subset of your data. You may only want to work with one part of your data. To create a subset of your data, use the `filter()` to create the subset. This will select the rows that satisfy a certain condition. Create a subset of `data1` where only the positive values of `var1` are present. Use the `filter()` and state `var1>0`.


```{r}
data1 |> filter(var1>0)
```


If you know which rows you want, you can use the `slice()` and specify the rows as a vector. Create a subset of `data1` and select the rows 100 to 200 and 300 to 400.

```{r}
data1 |> slice(c(100:200, 300:400))
```

If you need random sample of your `data1`, use the `slice_sample(n = N)` and specify the number you want. It will create a data set of randomly selected rows. Create a random sample of `data1` of 100 rows.

```{r}
data1 |>  slice_sample(n = 100)
```

If you want a random sample that is proportion of your original data size, use the `slice_sample(prop = X)`. Specify the proportion that you want from the data. Create a random sample of `data1` that is only 2/7th of the original size.


```{r}
data1 |> slice_sample(prop = 2/7)
```

### Creating Variables

Some times you may need to transform variables to a new variable. This can be done by using the `mutate()` where you specify the name of the new variable and set equal to the transformation of other variables. Using the `data2` data set, create a new variable called `logvar1` and set that to the log of `va1`.


```{r}
data2 |> mutate(logvar1 = log(va1))
```

The `mutate()` allows you to create multiple new variables at once. Id addition to `logvar1`, create a new variable called `sqrtvar2` and set that equal to the square root of `va2`.

```{r}
data2 |> mutate(logvar1 = log(va1), 
                sqrtvar2 = sqrt(va2))
```


If you want to create categorical variables, use the `mutate()` and the `if_else()`.  The `if_else()` requires three arguments:  `condition` argument, `true` argument, and `false` argument. The first argument requires a condition that will return a logical value. If true, then R will assign what is stated in the `true` argument, otherwise R will assign what is in the `false` argument. To begin, find the median of `va1` from `data2` and assign it to `medval`.


```{r}
medval <- data2$va1 |> median() 
```

No create a  new variable called `diva1` where if `va1` is greater than the median of `va1`,  assign it "A", otherwise assign it "B".


```{r}
data2 |> mutate(diva1=if_else(va1>medval,"A","B"))
```


### Merging Datasets

One of the last thing is to go over how to merge data sets together.  To merge the data sets, we use the `full_join()`. The `full_join()` needs two data sets (separated by commas) and the `by` argument which provides the variables needed (must be the same name for each data set) to merge the data sets. Merge `data1` and `data2` with the variable `ID1`.


```{r}
full_join(data1, data2, by = "ID1")
```

The `full_join()` allows you to merge data sets using two variables instead of one. All you need to do is specify `by` argument with a vector specifying the arguments. Merge `data2` and `data3` by `ID_1` and `ID_2`.

```{r j_2-solution}
full_join(data2, data3, by = c("ID_1","ID_2"))
```

## Reshaping Data

This section focuses on reshaping the data to prepare it for analysis. For example, to conduct longitudinal data analysis, you will need to have long data. Reshaping data may be with converting data from wide to long, converting back from long to wide, splitting variables, splitting rows and merging variable.
The functions used in this lesson are from the `tidy` package

### Wide to Long Data

Converting data from wide to long is necessary when the data looks like `data4`, view `data4`:

```{r}
data4
```

 
Let's say `data4` represents biomarker data. Variable `ID1` represents a unique identifier for the participant. Then `X1`, `X2`, `X3`, and `X4` represents a value collected for a participant at different time point. This is know as repeated measurements. This data is considered wide because the repeated measurements are on the same row. To make it long, the repeated measurements must be on the same column.

To convert data from long to wide, we will use the `pivot_longer()` with the first argument taking variables of the repeated measurements, `c(X1:X4)` or `X1:X4`, second you will need to specify the `names_to` argument which specifies the variable name to store the long variables, lastly you will need to specify the `values_to` argument that specifies variable to store the values in the long data set. Convert the `data4` to long and name the variable names column `"measurement"`, and values column `"value"`.


```{r}
data4 |> pivot_longer(X1:X4, 
                      names_to = "measurement", 
                      values_to = "value")
```

### Long to Wide

If you need to convert data from long to wide, use the `pivot_wider()`. You will need to specify the `names_from` argument which specifies the variable names for the wide data set, and you will need to specify the `values_from` argument that specifies variable that contains the values in the long data set. Convert `data5` from long to wide data. Note, you must specify the arguments for this function.

```{r}
data5 |> pivot_wider(names_from = measurement, 
                     values_from = value)
```


### Spliting Variables

Before we begin, look at `data6`:

```{r}
data6
```

Notice how the `merge` variable has two values separated by "/". If we need to split the variable into two variables, we need to specify the `separate()`. All you need to specify is the variable you need to split, the name of the 2 new variables, in a character vector, and how to split the variable `"/"`. Split the variable `merge` in `data6` to two new variables called `X1` and `X2`.

```{r}
data6 |> separate(merge, c("X1", "X2"), "/")
```

### Splitting Rows

The variable `merge` in `data6` was split into different variables before, now instead of variables, let's split it into different rows instead. To do this, use the `separate_rows()`. All you need to specify the variable name and the `sep` argument (must state the argument). Split the `merge` variable from `data6` into different rows.


```{r}
data6 |> separate_rows(merge, sep = "/")
```

### Merging Rows

If you need to merge variables together, similar to the `merge` variable, use the `unite()`. All you need to do is specify the variables to merge, the `col` argument which specifies the name of the new variable (as a character), and the `sep` argument which indicates the symbol for separate value, as a character. Note, you need to specify the bot the `col` argument and `sep` argument.  Merge variable `X3` and `X4` in `data6` to a new variable called `merge2` and have the separator be a hyphen.


```{r}
data6 |> unite(X3, X4, col = "merge2", sep="-")
```


## Applied Example

Here is an applied example where you will use what you learned from the previous lesson and convert `data7` into `data8`. `data7` has a wide data format which contains time points labeled as `vX`, where `X` represents the time point number. At each time point, the mean, sd, and median was taken. You will need to convert the data to long where each row represents a new time point, and each row will have 3 variables representing the mean, sd, and median. View both `data7` and `data8` to have a better idea on what is going on. Remember you need to convert `data7` to `data8`. 

```{r}
#| include: false

data8 <- data7 |> pivot_longer(`v1/mean`:`v4/median`,
                               names_to = "measurement",
                               values_to = "value") |> 
          separate(measurement,c("time","stat"),sep="/") |> 
          pivot_wider(names_from = stat,values_from = value)

```


```{r}
data7
data8
```


Now that you viewed the data set, type the code to convert `data7` to `data8`. Try working it out before you look at the solution.

```{r}
data7 |> pivot_longer(`v1/mean`:`v4/median`,
                      names_to = "measurement",
                      values_to = "value") |> 
          separate(measurement, c("time","stat"), sep="/") |> 
          pivot_wider(names_from = stat, values_from = value)
```
