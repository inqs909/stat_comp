R packages contain extra functions to conduct uncommon statistical models.\n\nAs of right now, the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a set of comprehensive packages to prepare and analyze data. To install tidyverse, use the following line in the console:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Topics\n\n|Topic | Description |\n|:-|:-|\n|R Programming | Provide with a brief introduction to R programming. Topics include basic computations, control flow statements, functional programming, and scripting tips and tricks. |\n|Simulations | Explore different algorithms to generate random variables. |\n|Randomizations | Learn how to implement different permutation tests. |\n|Monte Carlo Methods | Implement Monte Carlo methods to approximate integrals and distributions. |\n|Bootstrapping | Conduct different bootstrapping techniques to construct confidence intervals. |\n| Data Manipulation, Summarization, and Graphics| Learn how to analyze real-world data |\n| Reporting Data | Learn how to use Quarto to generate reports and presentations. |\n| Debugging and Efficient Programming | Learn how write efficient R code and implement Rcpp into your programs. |\n \n\n",
