To begin, when something is in a gray block, `_`, this indicates that R code is being used. When I am talking about an R Object, it will be displayed as a word. For example, we will be using the R object `mtcars`. When I am talking about an R function, it will be displayed as a word followed by an open and close parentheses. For example, we will use the mean function denoted as `mean()` (read this as \"mean function\"). When I am talking about an R argument for a function, it will be displayed as a word following by an equal sign. For example, we will use the data argument denoted as `data=` (read this as \"data argument\"). When I am referencing an R package, I will use `::` (two colons) after the name. For example, in this tutorial, I will use the `ggplot2::` (read this as \"ggplot2 package\") Lastly, if I am displaying R code for your reference or to run, it will be displayed on its own line. There are many components in R, and my hope is that this will help you understand what components am I talking about.\n\n## Base R Plotting\n\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis tutorial provides an introduction on how to create different graphics in R. For this tutorial, we will focus on plotting different components from the `mtcars` data set.\n\n### Contents\n\n1. Basic\n\n2. Grouping\n\n3. Tweaking\n\n\n### Basic Graphics\n\nHere we will use the built-in R functions to create different graphics. The main function that you will use is the `plot()`. It contains much of the functionality to create many different plots in R. Additionally, it works well for different classes of R objects. It will provide many important plots that you will need for a certain statistical analysis.\n\n### Scatter Plot\n\nLet's first create a scatter plot for one variable using the `mpg` variable. This is done using the `plot()` and setting the first argument `x=` to the vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(mtcars$mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that the x-axis is the index (which is not informative) and the y-axis is the `mpg` values.\n\nLet's connect the points with a line. This is done by setting the `type=` to `\"l\"`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(mtcars$mpg, type = \"l\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's add the points back to the plot and keep the lines. What we are going to do is first create the scatter plot as we did before, but we will also use the `lines()` to add the lines. The `lines()` needs the `x=` which is a vector of points (`mpg`). The two lines of code must run together.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(mtcars$mpg)\nlines(mtcars$mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, let's create a more realistic scatter plot with 2 variables. This is done by specifying the `y=` with another variable in addition to the `x=` in the `plot=`. Plot a scatter plot between `mpg` and `disp`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$disp)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, let's change the the axis labels and plot title. This is done by using the arguments `main=`, `xlab=`, and `ylab`. The `main=` changes the title of the plot. \n\n### Histogram\n\nTo create a histogram, use the `hist()`. The `hist()` only needs `x=` which is numerical vector. Create a histogram with the `mpg` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(mtcars$mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you want to change the number of breaks in the histogram, use the `breaks=`. Create a new histogram of the `mpg` variable with ten breaks.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(mtcars$mpg, breaks = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above histograms provide frequencies instead of relative frequencies. If you want relative frequencies, use the `freq=` and set it equal to `FALSE` in the `hist()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(mtcars$mpg, freq = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Density Plot\n\nA density plot can be used instead of a histogram. This is done by using the `density()` to create an object containing the information to create density function. Then, use the `plot()` to display the plot. The only argument the `density()` needs is the `x=` which is the data to be used. Create a density plot the `mpg` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(density(mtcars$mpg))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, if we want to overlay the density function over a histogram, use the `lines()` with the output from the `density()` as its main input. First create the histogram using the `hist()` and setting the `freq=` to `FALSE`. Then use the `lines()` to overlay the density. Make sure to run both lines together.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(mtcars$mpg, freq = FALSE)\nlines(density(mtcars$mpg))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Box Plots\n\nA commonly used plot to display relevant statistics is the box plot. To create a box plot use the `boxplot()`. The function only needs the `x=` which specifies the data to create the box plot. Use the box plot function to create a box plot on for the variable `mpg`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboxplot(mtcars$mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you want to make the box plot horizontal, use `horizontal=` and set it equal to `TRUE`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboxplot(mtcars$mpg, horizontal = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Bar Chart\n\nA histogram shows you the frequency for a continuous variable. A bar chart will show you the frequency of a categorical or discrete variable. To create a bar chart, use the `barplot()`. The main argument it needs is the `height=` which needs to an object from the `table()`. Create a bar chart for the `cyl` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(table(mtcars$cyl))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Pie Chart\n\nWhile I do not recommend using a pie chart, R is capable of creating one using the `pie()`. It only needs the `x=` which is a vector numerical quantities. This could be the output from the `table()`. Create a pie chart with the `cyl` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npie(table(mtcars$cyl))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Grouping\n\nSimilar to obtaining statistics for certain groups, plots can be grouped to reveal certain trends. We will look at a couple of methods to visualize different groups.\n\n#### One Variable Grouping\n\nTwo ways to display groups is by using color coding or panels. I will show you what I think is the best way to group variables. There may be better ways to do this, such as using the ggplot2 package. Before we begin, create three new R objects that are a subset of the `mtcars` data set into 3 different data sets with for the three different values of the `cyl` variable: \"4\", \"6\", and \"8\". use the `subset()` to create the different data sets. Name the new R objects `mtcars_4`, `mtcars_6`, and `mtcars_8`, respectively. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmtcars_4 <- subset(mtcars, cyl == 4)\nmtcars_6 <- subset(mtcars, cyl == 6)\nmtcars_8 <- subset(mtcars, cyl == 8)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Scatter Plot\n\nTo create different colors points for their respective label associated `cyl` variable. First create a base scatter plot using the `plot()` to set up the plot. Then one by one, overlay a set of new points on the base plot using the `points()`. The first two arguments should be the vectors of data from their respective R object subset. Also, use the `col=` to change the color of the points. The `col=` takes either a string or a number.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp)\npoints(mtcars_4$mpg, mtcars_4$disp, col = \"red\")\npoints(mtcars_6$mpg, mtcars_6$disp, col = \"blue\")\npoints(mtcars_8$mpg, mtcars_8$disp, col = \"green\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Histogram\n\nNow, it us more difficult to overlay histograms on a plot to different colors. Therefore, a panel approach may be more beneficial. This can be done by setting up R to plot a grid of plots. To do this, use the `par()` to tell R how to set up the grid. Then use the `mfrow=`, which is a vector of length two, to set up a grid. The `mfrow=` usually has an input of `c(ROWS,COLS)` which states the number of rows and the number of columns. Once this is done, the next plots you create will be used to populate the grid.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow=c(1,3))\nhist(mtcars_4$mpg)\nhist(mtcars_6$mpg)\nhist(mtcars_8$mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEvery time you use the `par()`, it will change how graphics are created in an R session. Therefore, all your plots will follow the new graphic parameters. You will need to reset it by typing `dev.off()`.\n\n##### Bar Chart\n\nTo visualize two categorical variables, we can use a color-coded bar chart to compare the frequencies of the categories. This is simple to do with the `barplot()`. First, use the `table()` to create a cross-tabulation of the frequencies for two variables. Then use the `boxplot()` to visualize both variables. Then use `legend=` to create a label when the bar chart is color-coded. Additionally, use the `beside=` argument to change how the plot looks. Use the code below to compare the variables `cyl` and `am` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$am), beside = TRUE, legend = rownames(table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$am)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that I use the `rownames()` to label the legend.  \n\n### Tweaking\n\n#### Labels\n\nThe main tweaking of plots I will talk about is changing the the axis label and titles. For the most part, each function allows you to use the `main=`, `xlab=`, and `ylab=`. The `main=` allows you to change the title. The `xlab=` and `ylab=` allow you to change the labels for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. Create a scatter plot for the variables `mpg` and `disp` and change the labels.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp, main = \"MPG vs Displacement\", xlab = \"MPG\", ylab = \"Displacement\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## ggplot2\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe `ggplot2::` provides a set of functions to create different graphics. For more information on plotting in `ggplot2::`, please visit the this excellent [resource](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). Here we will discuss some of the basics to the `ggplot2::``. To me, `ggplot2::`` creates a plot by adding layers to a base plot. The syntax is designed for you to change different components of a plot in an intuitive manner. For this tutorial, we will focus on plotting different components from the `mpg` data set.\n\n\n#### Contents\n\n1. Basic\n\n2. Grouping\n\n3. Themes/Tweaking\n\n\n### Basics\n\nTo begin, the `ggplot2::` really works well when you are using data frames. If you have any output that you want to plot, convert into to a data frame. Once we have our data set, the first thing you would want to do is specify the main components of your base plot. This will be what will be plotted on your x-axis, and what will be plotted on your y-axis. Next, you will create the the type of plot. Lastly, you will add different layers to tweak the plot for your needs. This can be changing the layout or even overlaying another plot. The `ggplot2::`` provides you with tools to do almost everything you need to create a plot easily. \n\n\n\n\nBefore we begin plotting, load the `ggplot2::` in R.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, when we create a base plot, we will use the `ggplot()`. This will initialize the data that we need to use with the `data=` and how to map it on the x and y axis with the `mapping=`. With the `mapping=`, you will need to use the `aes()` which constructs the mapping function for the base plot. The `aes()` requires the `x=` and optionally uses the `y=` to set which values represents the x and y axis. The `aes()` also accepts other arguments for grouping or other aesthetics. \n\nBefore we begin, create a new variable in `mtcars` called `ind` and place a numeric vector which contains integers from 1 to 32.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmtcars$ind <- c(1:32)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, let's create the base plot and assign it to `gg_1`. Use the `ggplot()` and set `mtcars` as its data and the variable `ind` as `x=` and `mpg` as the `y=`\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(ind, mpg))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis base plot is now used to create certain plots. Plots are created by adding functions to the base plot. This is done by using the `+` operator and then a specific `ggplot2::` function. Below we will go over some of the functions necessary. \n\n### Scatter Plot\n\nTo create a scatter plot in `ggplot2::`, add the `geom_point()` to the base plot. You do not need to specify any arguments in the function. Create a scatter plot to `gg_1`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_1 + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we want to put lines instead of points, we will need to use the `geom_point()`. Change the points to a line.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_1 + geom_line()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo overlay points to the plot, add `geom_point()` as well as `geom_line()`. Add points to the plot above.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_1 + geom_point() + geom_line()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo create a 2 variable scatter plot. You will just need to specify the `x=` and `y=` in the `aes()`. Create a base plot using the `mtcars`\ndata set and use the `mpg` and `disp` as the x and y variables, respectively, and assign in it to `gg_2`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow create a scatter plot using `gg_2`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_2 + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Histogram and Density Plot\n\nTo create a histogram and density plots, create a base plot and specify the variable of interest in the `aes()`, only specify one variable. Create a base plot using the `mtcars` data set and the `mpg` variable. Assign it to `gg_3`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_3 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg))\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo create a histogram, use the `geom_histogram()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_3 + geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above plot shows a histogram, but the number of bins is quite large. We can change the bin width argument, `binwidth=`, the the `geom_histogram()`. Change the bin width to seven.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_3 + geom_histogram(binwidth = 7)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Density Plot\n\nTo create a density plot, use the `geom_density()`. Create a density plot for the `mpg` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_3 + geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Both\n\nSimilar to adding lines and points in the same plot, you can add a histogram and a density plot by adding both the `geom_histogram()` and `geom_density()`. However, in the `geom_histogram()`, you must add `aes(y=..density..)` to create a frequency histogram. Create a plot with a histogram and a density plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_3 + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),bins=7) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Box Plots\n\nIf you need to create a box plot, use the `stat_boxplot()`. Create a boxplot for the variable `mpg`. All you need to do is add `stat_boxplot()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_3 + stat_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Bar Charts\n\nCreating a bar chart is similar to create a box plot. All you need to do is use the `stat_count()`. First create a base plot using the `mtcars` data sets and the `cyl` variable for the mapping and assign it to `gg_4`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_4 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow create the bar plot by adding the `stat_count()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_4 + stat_count()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Grouping\n\nThe `ggplot2::`` easily allows you to create plots from different groups. We will go over some of the arguments and functions to do this.\n\n#### One Variable Grouping\n\n##### Scatter Plot\n\nTo begin, we want to specify the grouping variable within the `aes()` with the `color=`. Additionally, the argument works best with a factor variable, so use the `factor()` to create a factor variable. Create a base plot from the `mtcars` data set using `mpg` and `disp` for the x and y axis, respectively, and set the `color=` equal to the `factor(cyl)`. Assign it the R object `gg_5`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_5 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, color=factor(cyl)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nOnce the base plot is created, `ggplot2::`` will automatically group the data in the plots. Create the scatter plot from the base plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_5 + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you want to change the shapes instead of the color, use the `shape=`. Create a base plot from the `mtcars` data set using `mpg`, and `disp` for the x and y axis, respectively, and group it by `cyl` with the `shape=`. Assign it the R object `gg_6`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_6 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, shape=factor(cyl)))\ngg_6 + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Histograms\n\nHistograms can be grouped by different colors. This is done by using the `fill=` within the `aes()` in the base plot. Assign it the R object `gg_7`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_7 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, fill = factor(cyl)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow create a histogram from the base plot `gg_7`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_7 + geom_histogram(bins = 6, alpha = 0.3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSometimes we would like to view the histogram on separate plots. The `facet_wrap()` and the `flact_grid()` allows this. Using either function, you do not need to specify the grouping factor in the `aes()`. You will add `facet_wrap()`  to the plot. It needs a formula argument with the grouping variable. Using the R object `gg_3` create side by side plots using the `cyl` variable. Remember to add `geom_histogram()`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_3+geom_histogram() + facet_wrap( ~ cyl)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Density Plot\n\nSimilar to histograms, density plots can be grouped by variables the same way.\nUsing `gg_7`, create color-coded density plots. All you need to do is add `geom_density()`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_7 + geom_density(alpha=0.3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing `gg_3`, create side by side density plots. You need to do is add `geom_density()` and `facet_wrap()` to group with the `cyl` variable. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_3 + geom_density() + facet_wrap( ~ cyl)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Bar Chart\n\nTo create a side by side bar plot, you can use the `facet_wrap()` with a grouping variable. Using `gg_4`, create a side by side bar plot using `vs` as the grouping variable. Remember to add `stat_count()` as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_4 + stat_count() + facet_wrap(~vs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-43-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you want to compare the bars from different group in one plot, you can use the `fill=` from the `aes()`. The `fill=` just needs a factor variable (use `factor()`). First create a base plot using the data `mtcars`, variable `cyl` and grouping variable `vs`. Assign it to `gg_8`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_8 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, fill = factor(vs)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow create a bar chart by adding `stat_count()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_8 + stat_count()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you want to grouping bars to be side by side, use the `position=` in the `stat_count()` and set it equal to `\"dodge\"`. Create the bar plot using the `position = \"dodge\"`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_8 + stat_count(position = \"dodge\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Themes/Tweaking\n\nIn this section, we will talk about the basic tweaks and themes to `ggplot2::`. However. `ggplot2::` is much more powerful and can do much more. Before we begin, lets look at object `gg_9` to understand the plot. To view a plot, use the `plot()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(gg_9)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Title\n\nTo change the title, add the `ggtitle()` to the plot. Put the new title in quotes as the first argument. Change the title for `gg_9`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_9 + ggtitle(\"Scatter Plot\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-49-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Axis\n\nChanging the labels for a plot, add the `xlab()` and `ylab()`, respectively. The first argument contains the phrase for the axis. Change the axis labels for `gg_9`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_9 + xlab(\"MPG\") + ylab(\"Displacement\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Themes\n\nIf you don't like how the plot looks, `ggplot2::` has custom themes you can add to the plot to change it. These functions usually are formatted as `theme_*()`, where the `*` indicates different possibilities. I personally like how `theme_bw()` looks. Change the theme of `gg_9`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngg_9 + theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](plot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAdditionally, you can change certain part of the theme using the `theme()`. I encourage you to look at what are other possibilities.\n\n### Saving plot\n\nIf you want to save the plot, use the `ggsave()`. Read the help documentation for the functions capabilities.",
