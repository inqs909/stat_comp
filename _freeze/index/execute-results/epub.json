A book designed to give undergraduate students exposure to several topics related to computational statistics and programming in R.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis book is a work in progress and will contain several grammatical errors and unfinished chapters. The final product is expected to be ready by the 2026-27 Academic Year.\n:::\n\nThis work is published under a [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. \n\n\n## Preface\n\nThis is a book created to be used for a statistical computing course at the undergraduate level.\n\n### Installing R\n\n[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source programming language used to conduct statistical analysis.\nYou can freely download and install R [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).\n\n### Installing Positron\n\n[Positron](https://positron.posit.co/start.html) is an Integrated Development Environment ([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)) used for data science. It contains several tools needed to extend your programming and project management skills. \n\nYou can download and install the open-source (free) version of Positron [here](https://positron.posit.co/download.html).\n\n### Installing Quarto\n\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a technical documentation system that allows you to embed narrative, code, and output in one document.\nQuarto should be automatically install from Positron; however, you can update (or install) it [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).\n\n### Installing R Packages\n\nR Packages extends the functionality from the base functions in R. R packages contain extra functions to conduct uncommon statistical models.\n\nThe [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a set of comprehensive packages to prepare and analyze data. To install tidyverse, use the following line in the console:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Topics\n\n|Topic | Description |\n|:-|:-|\n\n|Monte Carlo Methods | Explore different algorithms to generate random variables. |\n|Randomizations | Learn how to implement different permutation tests. |\n|Bootstrapping | Conduct different bootstrapping techniques to construct confidence intervals. |\n|Simulations | Implement Monte Carlo methods to approximate hypothesis tests, simulation studies, and power analysis. |\n|R Programming | Provide with a brief introduction to R programming. Topics include basic computations, control flow statements, functional programming, scripting, summarization and plotting|\n \n\n",
